People ask me what the 'T' stands for in my name. If you're a man, the 'T' stands for tough. If you're a woman or child, it stands for tender!
I remember one time I tried to pity this fool. He told me his name was Jeff. He was married. He pulled out his wallet and showed me three pictures of his kids; Kelly, Robert, Brittany. Real cute kids. Don't get too close man. It's hard to pity a fool if you get too close.
I pity the university for not giving T enough time. You know I got all duded up, got dressed, the students were all ready for me, then they gave me short time. So I pity them. So if they want to be unpitied, they'll invite me back and give me more time.
You don't rehearse Mr. T, you just turn him loose.

I pity the fool, thug, or soul who tries to take over the world.
Shut up, fool!
